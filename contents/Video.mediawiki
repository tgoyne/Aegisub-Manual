Aegisub isn't a video (or media) player, but it still supports loading and working with video in various ways.

==Opening video==
To load a video file, go to the ''Video'' menu and press ''Open video file''. What video files you can open depends on your [[Options#Video|video provider]]. To use a dummy (mockup, blank) video, press ''Use dummy video''.

===Supported formats: Windows===
On Windows, your video provider is ''Avisynth'' by default. What this actually means for you as the user is somewhat complicated. Aegisub will try its best to load your video in the most reliable way possible. There are currently no less than six ways it will try with Avisynth:
* '''Import()''' - Avisynth builtin function. Used to load Avisynth scripts, never used for anything else.
* '''AviSource()''' - Avisynth builtin function. Only works on AVI files, obviously. Requires a working Video for Windows (VfW) decoder to open the video. Tried first for .avi files, never for anything else. If it fails, Aegisub will try ffmpegSource() instead, and if that fails too try DSS2(), and if that too fails try DirectShowSource() (see below).
* '''MPEG2Source()''' - Only used to load .d2v files (DVD2AVI project files; otherwise known as indexed .VOB's ripped from DVD's). Tries to use neuron2's [http://neuron2.net/dgmpgdec/dgmpgdec.html DGDecode] to open the file; if Aegisub can't find or load that it'll try the old mpeg2dec3.dll instead; if that too fails, Aegisub returns an error. 
* '''ffmpegSource()''' - Tries to use Myrsloik's [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=127037 ffmpegsource plugin] to try to load the file; see its manual for information on what formats and codecs are supported and what problems they may suffer from. Tried first for anything that isn't .avs, .avi or .d2v. If Aegisub can't find it or it returns an error, falls back on DSS2() or if that isn't available, DirectShowSource().
* '''DSS2()''' - Tries to find, load and use Haali's DirectShowSource2 plugin (comes with the [http://haali.cs.msu.ru/mkv/ Haali Media Splitter] package and with the [http://cccp-project.net CCCP]). That will in turn try to use your computer's DirectShow environment to open the file. Theoretically any file renderable by DirectShow should be supported, but since you are at the mercy of third-party splitters and decoders, your mileage may vary. As a rule of thumb, if it's playable in Windows Media Player, Aegisub should be able to load it. Do note that DSS2 converts variable framerate files to constant. Usually this is what you want and expect but if you're doing proper VFR subtitles, it isn't.
* '''DirectShowSource()''' - Uses DirectShowSource() (which ships with Avisynth) to try to load the file. Basically the same as DSS2, with the exception that it doesn't convert VFR to CFR. '''Warning:''' DSS is known to have problems with frame-accurate seeking. Do not use it if you can avoid it.
