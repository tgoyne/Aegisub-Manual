To put it short, the changes from Automation 3 to Automation 4 are huge, almost everything has been completely redesigned and rewritten. You should however find that many things still work the same, and the rest work better, hopefully. Automation 3 scripts can still run with little or no modifications, see the [[moving_from_Automation_3]] page for details on that.


## Architectural changes  ##

These are the changes in how the scripting engine(s) integrate with Aegisub, ie. how scripts are loaded and managed and not as much what happens when they are running.

Actually, what is called Automation 4 is only the architecture described here. When you use Automation 4 to run scripts written in Lua (and are not Automation 3 scripts) it's called Automation 4 Lua.

The most obvious change is the support for multiple scripting engines. Automation 3 was built around only supporting Lua, Automation 4 has been designed to support scripts written in all kinds of languages as long as a scripting engine has been implemented into it. Implementing a new scripting engine consists of implementing about 5-8 C++ classes and quite possibly a bunch more helpers. The basic implementation should be a few day's work and then an uncountable number of hours for documentation, standard includes and support. If you are interested in implementing support for a new scripting language please contact the Aegisub team.

Automation 4 now supports "plugging in" script functionality in several different places. Each different kind of functionality a script can support is called a "feature". Currently this really only means the export filters supported by Automation 3 and then macros. Export filters appear in the Export dialogue and are intended for large batch-operations. Macros appear in the Automation menu and are intended for smaller tasks. A third, still not fully drafted feature, is support for scripting file format reading and writing, to be able to import and export all the most exotic subtitle file formats in existence.

Macro features can retrieve the current selection in the subtitle grid, modify the subtitles in-line and change the selection upon return. They can also set one or more Undo points. Last but not least, they can show dialogue boxes to get more information from the user.

Finally, one script file can provide more than one feature, also more than one of each kind of supported feature. A script file can also provide no features at all, though that's not very useful.


## The Lua scripting engine  ##

The probably single biggest and most important change from Automation 3 to Automation 4 Lua is that the Lua version has been upgraded from 5.0 to 5.1. While there are a large number of changes between the two versions, the perhaps most important for writing Automation 4 Lua scripts is the modulo operator that has finally been introduced into the language. You can see more details at [the Lua homepage](http://www.lua.org/versions.html).

The rest of the changes to Lua scripting interface can best be summed up as: Give as much control as possible to the script and don't do any unrequested data generation.

In more detail, these are the main points of the changes from Automation 3 to Automation 4 Lua. They are discussed in more detail below.

* No more a fixed entry point, script entry points are instead defined with `register_xxx` functions
* Direct manipulation of the subtitle file rather than manipulating a large Lua table
* Much more direct control over the entire execution process
* Various changes in the data structures used
* More complete Unicode support in include files
* More advanced layout calculations in karaskel include file

You no longer need to name your functions anything specific, rather you tell Aegisub what your entry point functions are called. What you do is register each feature you want, using the `aegisub.register_macro` and `aegisub.register_filter` functions. (Exception: If you use the [[karaoke skeleton functions|Automation/Lua/Modules/#Karaoke_skeletons]] you do need to follow some specific naming schemes and should not register any features.)

Instead of getting a huge table with all lines in the subtitle file, Automation 4 Lua provides your script with a "user data object" you can use to get, save and replace lines in the subtitle file with. (This object is usually called the _subs object_.) Using this subs object you can not only get the dialogue lines in the subtitle file, but also manipulate the style lines and the Script Info section. On the other hand, you are no longer given a _styles_ or _meta_ table directly, but the karaskel include has [[a function|Automation/Lua/Modules/#karaskel.collect_head]] to extract that information.

As a result of the direct manipulation of the subtitle file you can now do, you also have much more control over what happens when during script execution. Automation 3 always split the script execution up in three phases: Generate input, run processing, read output. Using the subs object you can instead intermix those three phases freely, or just do as usual. This is especially convenient for macros, since they only need to touch the lines they actually modify, rather than needing to import the entire file and having it re-read by Aegisub when done. The skeletons provided by karaskel.lua can to an extent automate managing the execution process.

The data structures used have also been changed to better support the more complete subtitle file representation and to better reflect the philosophy of doing as little as possible before requested. For example, the karaoke data tables that were an inherent part of the line data structure in Automation 3 are no longer automatically generated, instead you use a separate function to have them generated. If you use karaskel, you will however not need to worry about that. A couple of new fields have also been introduced to support the changes in the ASS2 format and some preparations are made to support further evolutions of the ASS format, such as ASS3 and AS5. The actual changes are too many to list here.

A new _[[unicode.lua|Automation/Lua/Modules/]]_ include file has been introduced. This file provides a much more clean and usable interface for manipulating UTF-8 encoded text than the old `next_utf_char` and `utf_len` functions.

Last but not least, the text layout algorithms used in karaskel have been improved a lot and now, among other things, support sub-pixel positioned text, proper handling of inter-syllable spaces and an advanced furigana layout algorithm. The furigana layout algorithm also produces data structures so similar to syllable structures you can in effect use exactly the same code to produce effects for both main syllables and furigana.
