Template lines and code lines can take a number of modifiers.

This is a space-separated list of words in the Effect field following the <code>template</code> or <code>code</code> keyword.

While modifiers can be combined to some extent, not all are compatible, and not all work on both code lines and for templates.

There is a special set of modifiers that declare the class of the template line or code line.

== Class declaring modifiers ==

Both template lines and code lines can be produced without having a class modifier. Having one is still recommended for clarity, however.

A template line without a class modifier is implicitly given the <code>syl</code> modifier.

A code line without a class modifier is implicitly given the <code>once</code> modifier.

=== once ===

This class modifier is only valid for code lines.

Code lines with the <code>once</code> modifier are run exactly once during Karaoke Templater execution, and are always run before any other code lines or templates. They are run in the order they are declared.

"code once" lines are primarily intended to declare functions for use in templates.

==== Example ====
 Comment: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:05.00,Default,,0000,0000,0000,code once,function setlayer(newlayer) line.layer = newlayer; return ""; end

This example declares a new function that changes the Layer field in the output line.

=== line ===

This class modifier is valid for both code lines and template lines.

When used on template lines it takes an optional parameter naming the line template the template line participates in. The template name must not match any template modifier names.

==== Examples ====

 Comment: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:05.00,Default,,0000,0000,0000,code line,fxgroup.funky = line.actor == "funky"

This code line is run once per input line. It enables/disables an effect group named "funky" depending on the Actor field of the input line.

 Comment: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:05.00,Default,,0000,0000,0000,template line,{\t($start,$end,\bord0)}

This template line declares an anonymous line template.

 Comment: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:05.00,Default,,0000,0000,0000,template line jumper,{\t($start,$mid,\frz-0.1)\t($mid,$end,\frz0}

This template line appends to a line template named "jumper"  or creates it if it doesn't exist.
