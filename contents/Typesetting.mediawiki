'''Typesetting''' involves the presentation of textual material in graphic form on paper or some other medium. In a subtitling context, this means two things:
* Presenting (a translation of) the spoking dialogue to the viewer in an easily readable and visually pleasing form.
* Translating any foreign-language background texts (such as episode titles, scene information like time/place and other plot-important writings on things in the background) and presenting the translation to the viewer, preferably so that it appears that the translation was there all along (yet retaining readability).

This page will attempt to give you an introduction on how to accomplish this. Unfortunately good taste is hard to teach, but we will do our best.

==Dialogue typesetting==
The main goal of dialogue typesetting is '''readability'''; everything else is just icing on the cake. There's no point in having subtitles if the viewer can't read them. Given the way human perception works, the following factors are important for readability:
* Using a plain, uncluttered, no-nonsense font. Sans-serif fonts (or serif fonts with thick serifs) are generally preferable, especially at low video resolutions, since thin serifs tend get blurred out, which naturally looks bad.
* Using a well-defined but not too thick border. The color is important; the higher the contrast against the main color the better.
