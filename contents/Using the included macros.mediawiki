Aegisub includes several macros. Here's a line-up of them.

== Apply karaoke template ==

This is the macro incantation of Karaoke Templater. See the page on [[Karaoke Templater]] for how to use this.

This macro is only available when there is at least one template line in the subtitle file.

== Make full-width ==
Converts all ASCII characters to Japanese "full-width" variations of them.

This can be useful if you need to typeset a sign translation vertically, such that the letters are "stacked".

This macro modifies all lines that are currently selected in the subtitles grid.

=== Example ===

Here's a typeset sign:

 {\fn@DFPGothic-EB\fs26\shad0\fe128\bord3\3c&H25485A&\c&HDEEBF1&\pos(456,184)\frz-90}Sign text

Notice that it uses an "@-font", a variation that exists of every CJK font that has "fullwidth" characters rotated 90 degrees from the baseline. Fullwidth characters include not just these fullwidth variations of the Latin alphabet but also Japanese kana and kanji, hanzi, hanja and various punctuation characters.

Now after running this macro on the line:

 {\fn@DFPGothic-EB\fs26\shad0\fe128\bord3\3c&H25485A&\c&HDEEBF1&\pos(456,184)\frz-90}Ｓｉｇｎ ｔｅｘｔ

This is what it looks before and after running the macro:

== Automatic karaoke lead-in ==
Automatically join several karaoke-timed lines up timing-wise and add appropriate <code>\k</code> tags in front of them.

This macro is designed to help creating karaoke effects, most importantly creating transitions and lead-ins for lines. It's well suited for using when the karaoke is timed but before applying effects, such as karaoke templates.

This macro requires at least two lines to be selected and it only works sensibly if the start-time of each selected line is larger than the start-time of the selected line that comes before it. It changes the timing of the selected lines and adds <code>\k</code> tags at the start of them except the first.

=== Example ===

Here's two lines of "tightly" timed karaoke:

 Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.46,0:00:46.28,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\k15}Ne{\k14}ver {\k14}gon{\k13}na {\k37}give {\k40}you {\k49}up
 Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.57,0:00:48.56,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\k13}Ne{\k13}ver {\k13}gon{\k13}na {\k36}let {\k46}you {\k65}down

Both lines start exactly when the first word starts being sung, and they end exactly when the last word ends.

Now if the ''Automatic karaoke lead-in'' macro is run on these two lines, they are changed into this:

 Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.46,<u>0:00:46.28</u>,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\k15}Ne{\k14}ver {\k14}gon{\k13}na {\k37}give {\k40}you {\k49}up
 Dialogue: 0,<u>0:00:46.28</u>,0:00:48.56,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,<u>{\k29}</u>{\k13}Ne{\k13}ver {\k13}gon{\k13}na {\k36}let {\k46}you {\k65}down

The start-time of the second line is changed so it matches the end-time of the first line, and a <code>\k</code> tag  is added to the start of the line, to make up for the shift otherwise created by this. This effectively creates an empty syllable that can be used as a "spacer" to create fade-in and fade-out effects.

The macro also shows this message:

 Smallest inter-line duration: 290 milliseconds

This simply says that the smallest duration between two lines it found, was 290 milliseconds, or 0.29 seconds, so that's as much time you have to make fade-in, fade-out and other transition effects, if you want every syllable-highlight to be fully visible.

== Clean tags ==
Cleans up some tags in the file.
