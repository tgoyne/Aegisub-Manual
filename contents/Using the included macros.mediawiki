Aegisub includes several macros. Here's a line-up of them.

== Make full-width ==
Converts all ASCII characters to Japanese "full-width" variations of them.

This can be useful if you need to typeset a sign translation vertically, such that the letters are "stacked".

=== Example ===

Here's a typeset sign:

 {\fn@DFPGothic-EB\fs26\shad0\fe128\bord3\3c&H25485A&\c&HDEEBF1&\pos(456,184)\frz-90}Sign text

Notice that it uses an "@-font", a variation that exists of every CJK font that has "fullwidth" characters rotated 90 degrees from the baseline. Fullwidth characters include not just these fullwidth variations of the Latin alphabet but also Japanese kana and kanji, hanzi, hanja and various punctuation characters.

Now after running this macro on the line:

 {\fn@DFPGothic-EB\fs26\shad0\fe128\bord3\3c&H25485A&\c&HDEEBF1&\pos(456,184)\frz-90}Ｓｉｇｎ ｔｅｘｔ

This is what it looks before and after running the macro:

== Automatic karaoke lead-in ==

{{Todo|Details, explanation, and why this is good.}}

== Clean tags ==
