Aegisub is highly customizable and hence has a large amount of user-changeable options. These are available in the options dialog box, found in the View menu. This page is a reference of all the available options.

All configuration data is stored in a plain text file named ''config.dat'', which is located in the [[Aegisub path specifiers|?user]] directory. If you want to reset Aegisub to its default options without reinstalling the program, you can just delete config.dat and restart Aegisub.

* '''Show Splash Screen'''
: If enabled, Aegisub will display its splash screen when starting up.
* '''Show Tip of the Day'''
: If enabled, Aegisub will display a (potentially) useful tip of the day after starting up.
* '''Auto Check for Updates'''
: If enabled, Aegisub will periodically check whether there is a newer version available, and alert you if there is. Requires a working connection to the internet.
* '''Save config.dat locally'''
: Normally, all configuration information for Aegisub is stored in a per-user basis in each system user's home directory. On Windows, this is <tt>%APPDATA%\Aegisub\</tt>, on Mac OS X this is <tt>$HOME/Application Support/Aegisub/</tt> and on other POSIX-like systems this is <tt>$HOME/.aegisub/</tt>. This is the default value of <tt>[[Aegisub path specifiers|?user]]</tt>. By enabling this option, <tt>?user</tt> will instead refer to the same directory as <tt>?data</tt>, effectively making all configuration global to the installation of Aegisub. This option can only be used safely when Aegisub is installed in a location you have regular write permissions for, usually somewhere inside your home directory.
* '''Limits for levels and recent files'''
: These boxes all control how many files Aegisub will save in the "recently opened" submenus, and also how many undo levels will be saved. Change to your preference, but beware: the more undo levels you use, the more RAM Aegisub will consume. This is particularly noticeable with large scripts. Having lots of recently opened files stored has no real drawback except making config.dat bigger and the submenus harder to navigate, though.

===General -> File save/load===

* '''Auto-backup'''
: If enabled, Aegisub will save a backup copy of each script you open, immediately on opening it. By default, it is saved to ''%APPDATA%/Aegisub/autoback/'' on Windows and ''$HOME/.aegisub/autoback'' on POSIX, but this can be changed (see below).
* '''Auto-save every X seconds'''
: Decides how often Aegisub should automatically save a copy of the script you are working on. Setting it to 0 disables autosaving. The automatically saved copy is stored in ''%APPDATA%/Aegisub/autosave/'' on Windows and ''$HOME/.aegisub/autosave'' on POSIX, but this can be changed (see below).
* '''Auto-save path'''
: Decides where to save autosaved copies of scripts you are working on. By default set to "autosave" in your Aegisub data directory (see above).
* '''Auto-backup path'''
: Decides where to save automatic backup copies of scripts. By default set to "autoback" in your Aegisub data directory (see above).
* '''Crash recovery path'''
: Decides where Aegisub should save scripts recovered from crashes. By default set to "recovered" in your Aegisub data directory (see above).
* '''Auto-load linked files'''
: Whenever you save a script, Aegisub also stores some information about what video, audio and timecodes files you had open while working on it, inside the script itself. This option decides what Aegisub does with these files that are "linked" to the script when opening it. If set to "ask", Aegisub will ask you if you want to load linked files. If set to "never", Aegisub will never load linked files, and likewise if set to "always", Aegisub will always try to load linked files (and report an error if the file(s) were not found).
