This tutorial will teach you how to load a song into Aegisub, how to enter the words for the song and how to add time-codes to the words to synchronise them with the song.

You don't need to have used Aegisub before to follow this tutorial.

== Before we begin ==

There's a few things you need to have ready before starting:

* The song itself. This can for example be as an MP3 file or inside a video. Aegisub can read the sound from video files, you don't need to create a separate sound file if the song is on a video.

* The words for the song. It's easiest if you have them in a plain text file (.txt file) broken into verses and stanzas already.

I am using an English song for demonstration here, but many of the more advanced functions in Aegisub are designed for use with songs in Japanese and other languages that often need transcription or transliteration into Latin script. I will show how to use those in a video tutorial.

== Loading the song ==

We'll start by creating a new file. You already have that if you have just started Aegisub.

Now open your song. Select '''Open Audio''' from the '''Audio''' menu...

...then select your song file.

Aegisub will now spend a short while reading the audio file.

When it's done, you should have a waveform display (the audio display) at the top of the Aegisub window. If you've used Aegisub before things might look a little different, it might be easier to follow the rest of this tutorial if you set things to look like on this picture.

We'll look at how to use the audio display for timing in a moment, but first let's get the lyrics for the song loaded.

== Entering the words ==

Now, to get the text in, we could just start typing it in...

'''But don't do that!''' It's much easier having it all in a text file, copying it and then pasting it into Aegisub. (You can often also just copy-paste directly from your favourite lyrics website.)

I have the lyrics in a text file, so I open that, select the text and copy it to the clipboard.

Now things get a little complicated, but don't worry, it really isn't hard :-)

There are two different places you can paste into Aegisub: The subtitles grid and the subtitles edit box. When you paste into the subtitles grid, you create new lines in the subtitle file. When you paste into the subtitles edit box you change the currently selected subtitle line.

We want to make sure we paste into the subtitles grid, so click once inside the grid area (at the bottom of the window) to set the input focus to that.

And now we can paste in the lyrics.

They should appear immediately as lines in the grid. Notice that they all have start and end times set to zero. This makes it easier when we're going to time each line of the lyrics to the song.

It might be a good idea to save your file now, just so you can easily save it later on without having to give it a name.

Remember that Aegisub automatically saves a copy of your file every 5 minutes, even if you haven't given it a name yet, so you rarely lose much work if something goes wrong.

Now we're ready to time the individual lines in the lyrics.
