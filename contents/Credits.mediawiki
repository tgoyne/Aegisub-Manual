===About===
Aegisub 2.00 was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and wxWidgets 2.8.6. The Automation module also uses the Lua Programming Language. The Regular Expressions code used in this program was written by Henry Spencer and included in wxWidgets. Aegisub also uses the PortAudio, libpng, zlib and ffmpeg libraries.
