'''This manual is a work in progress.''' It is at present incomplete and no information in it can be taken for granted. We attempt to be accurate on every point, to a reasonable degree.

'''Aegisub is software under constant development.''' While it is a goal to provide up-to-date documentation there will almost always be cases where the actual functionality of the program has changed since this documentation was last updated.
