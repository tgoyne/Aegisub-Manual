One of the most significant changes from Aegisub 1.10 to Aegisub 2.00 is the inclusion of Visual Typesetting tools, which allow you to visually drag, rotate and otherwise transform subtitles on the video screen, using your mouse.

== Overview ==

With the exception of the drag tool, every other tool affects only the active line (that is, the line whose text you see on the edit box). The line must be displayed on the current frame (that is, the current frame time must lie between the subtitle duration span) to be edited by any of the tools.

There are currently seven different visual typesetting tools: crosshair, drag, rotate on z axis, rotate on xy axes, scale, rectangular clip and vectorial clip.

== Tool Descriptions ==

=== Crosshair === 
This is the standard mode. Hovering the mouse over the video will show the script coordinates under the cursor, as well as a crosshair indicating the exact point that you are looking at. Double clicking a point will position the current line (using the \pos tag) on that position.

Also, while on this mode, you can right click to bring a context menu with other options:

* Save PNG snapshot: 
* Copy image to clipboard: 
* Save PNG snapshot (no subtitles): 
* Copy image to clipboard (no subtitles): 
* Copy coordinates to clipboard:
