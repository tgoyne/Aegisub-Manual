One of the most significant changes from Aegisub 1.10 to Aegisub 2.00 is the inclusion of Visual Typesetting tools, which allow you to visually drag, rotate and otherwise transform subtitles on the video screen, using your mouse.

== Overview ==

With the exception of the drag tool, every other tool affects only the active line (that is, the line whose text you see on the edit box). The line must be displayed on the current frame (that is, the current frame time must lie between the subtitle duration span) to be edited by any of the tools.

There are currently seven different visual typesetting tools: crosshair, drag, rotate on z axis, rotate on xy axes, scale, rectangular clip and vectorial clip.

The preview of all tools can either be real-time or delayed. This behaviour can be toggled by pressing the "Toggle Real-time" button at the end of visual typesetting toolbar. When in real-time, all changes you made are immediately visible on subtitles, at the cost of slower response. Otherwise, you will only see the subtitles themselves updating when you release the mouse. However, you will still see the visual positioning aids moving in real time.

== Tool Descriptions ==

=== Crosshair === 
This is the standard mode. Hovering the mouse over the video will show the script coordinates under the cursor, as well as a crosshair indicating the exact point that you are looking at. Double clicking a point will position the current line (using the \pos tag) on that position.

Also, while on this mode, you can right click to bring a context menu with other options:

* Save PNG snapshot: Saves a PNG snapshot of the current frame to the path specified in the [[options]]. This snapshot will be in the real video size, and WON'T be affected by zooming or aspect ratio overriding.
* Copy image to clipboard: Same as above, but copies the frame to the clipboard, instead of saving as a PNG. You can then paste it in any image editing software.
* Save PNG snapshot (no subtitles): Same as the previous option, but subtitles won't be visible in the image. This is only available if you're using a detached subtitles provider.
* Copy image to clipboard (no subtitles): Same as above, but copying to clipboard.
* Copy coordinates to clipboard: Copies the current mouse coordinates to clipboard, e.g. "230,152"
